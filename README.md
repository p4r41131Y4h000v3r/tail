Code Purpose

This script provides real-time monitoring and analysis of live website traffic for the domain "name.com". It does this by reading entries from the SSL log file (typically located under a panel or dashboard), which records detailed information about each secure (HTTPS) connection made to the website.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Shebang (#!/bin/bash)

Identifies the script as a Bash script to be run by the Bash shell.
Color Codes (ANSI Escape Sequences)

Defines color variables for visually distinguishing different elements in the output.
Log File Tailing (tail -f -n 1000)

tail: Displays the last part of a file.
-f: Continuously monitors the file and displays new lines as they appear (live updates).
-n 1000: Initially shows the last 1000 lines of the log file.
/home/t15k7e2hkhcw/access-logs/name.com-ssl_log: The path to the SSL log file (usually found within your web hosting control panel).
Awk Script (awk ...)

awk: A powerful text processing tool. Processes each log line individually.
Inside the Awk Script

BEGIN { prev_method = "" }: Initializes a variable for tracking previous request methods.

For each log line:

split($4,array,"["): Splits the timestamp field.

datestamp=array[2]: Extracts date and time.

website=$11: Extracts website domain ("name.com").

method=$6: Extracts HTTP request method (GET, POST, etc.).

ip=$1: Extracts client's IP address.

gsub("\"", "", method): Removes any quotes from the method.

IP Filtering: Skips log entries from specified IPs (e.g., internal or testing IPs).

OS & Device Detection: Tries to determine the user's operating system and device from the user agent string.

Output Formatting:

Uses printf to structure the output with color-coded elements.
%s placeholders are replaced with variables.
Colors are applied using $RED, $GREEN, etc.
Blank lines are added for readability.
Example Log Line (Unprocessed)

x.x.x.x- - [15/Jul/2024:12:34:56 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 2345 "https://www.google.com/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36"
Example Output (Processed)

Key Points

The script continuously updates, providing a live view of who's visiting your "name.com" website, their location, device, and what they're doing (GET, POST requests).
This information is invaluable for understanding website usage, troubleshooting issues, and detecting potential security threats.

Key Improvements:

Correct Log File Path: Updated to the path you provided.
White IP Address: The white variable is used to color the IP address white.
Simplified Output: Removed the redundant if statements for printing based on the previous method.
Spacing: Consistent five blank lines after each log entry for better readability.
Streamlined Comments: Clarified comments for easier understanding.
How to Use:

Save: Save the script as a .sh file (e.g., log_monitor.sh).
Permissions: Make it executable: chmod +x log_monitor.sh
Run: Execute it: ./log_monitor.sh
